    (for this use get book, update book)

Personal Book Manager - Frontend
Overview
  This is the frontend of the Personal Book Manager project, built using Next.js (App Router) with Tailwind CSS for styling.

It provides a responsive, user-friendly interface to:
  * Sign up, log in, and log out securely
  * View, add, edit, and delete books
  * Filter books by status or tags
  * View dashboard stats (total books, reading status, etc.)
The frontend communicates with a Node.js + Express backend via REST APIs using JWT authentication.


Tech Stack:
  * Next.js (App Router) – React framework for frontend
  * Tailwind CSS – Modern utility-first CSS framework
  * React Hot Toast – Notifications for success/error
  * Fetch API / API Service Module – Handles API requests
  * Environment Variables – NEXT_PUBLIC_BASEURL for API URL
